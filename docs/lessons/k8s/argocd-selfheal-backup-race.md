# Incident: ArgoCD selfHeal raced the Gitea backup's scale-to-0 — every backup ran hot

## Date
2026-06-12

## Time lost
~1h. No outage — found while verifying the backup pipeline, not because
anything visibly broke. That's the problem.

## Status
Resolved

## Context
- **System / component:** `gitea` namespace — backup CronJob + ArgoCD app
- **Scope:** every nightly Gitea backup since the CronJob was deployed
- **State before:** backups green every night, snapshots restorable,
  SQLite `integrity_check` passing on a test restore. Everything *looked*
  perfect.

## Symptoms
None, which is the point. The design says: scale Gitea to 0, back up the
idle SQLite file, scale back to 1. The job logged "Gitea scaled down" and
succeeded nightly. Only when watching a manual run live did it show up:

- The Gitea pod's `creationTimestamp` landed *inside* the backup window
  (recreated seconds after the scale-down).
- `managedFields` on the Deployment showed `argocd-controller` as the
  owner of `spec.replicas` with a timestamp matching the same second.

## Investigation
- Ran `kubectl create job --from=cronjob/gitea-backup` and polled
  `spec.replicas` every 10s → never saw 0, yet the job logged a
  successful scale-down → something restored it between polls.
- `--show-managed-fields` → `argocd-controller` wrote `replicas` at the
  exact second the pod came back → selfHeal, not the job's trap.
- First fix attempt *appeared* to fail: re-ran the test seconds after
  pushing and the race recurred. Dead end explained: the gitea
  Application object is itself synced by root-app (~3 min poll), so the
  new `ignoreDifferences` wasn't live in the cluster yet. Confirm the
  Application spec in-cluster before re-testing, not just the git state.

## Root cause
`selfHeal: true` reverts any live drift from git within seconds. The
backup's scale-to-0 *is* drift (`replicas: 1` in git), so ArgoCD scaled
Gitea back up almost immediately, and the backup copied the SQLite file
from a running instance every night. The `trap`/scale-1 logic in the job
masked nothing — the job still exited 0.

It never produced a corrupt snapshot (3:30am Gitea is idle, WAL
checkpointed), but the consistency guarantee the whole scale-down dance
exists for was fictional.

## Fix
Tell ArgoCD that nothing in git owns `spec.replicas` on this Deployment:

```yaml
# k8s/apps/gitea.yaml (Application)
spec:
  ignoreDifferences:
    - group: apps
      kind: Deployment
      name: gitea
      namespace: gitea
      jsonPointers:
        - /spec/replicas
  syncPolicy:
    syncOptions:
      - RespectIgnoreDifferences=true
```

`ignoreDifferences` alone only affects diffing; `RespectIgnoreDifferences`
makes syncs leave the field alone too.

## Verification
Re-ran the manual backup job after confirming the Application spec was
live in-cluster:

- 8 consecutive 5s polls saw `spec.replicas=0` (≈40s genuinely down)
- the new Gitea pod's `creationTimestamp` postdates the job's own
  "Scaling Gitea back up" step
- app stayed `Synced` throughout (no OutOfSync flapping nightly)

## Prevention
- Any future job that scales a GitOps-managed workload needs the same
  `ignoreDifferences` treatment — added to gotchas.md.
- `managedFields` (`--show-managed-fields`) is the fast way to answer
  "who keeps changing this field" — faster than log spelunking.
